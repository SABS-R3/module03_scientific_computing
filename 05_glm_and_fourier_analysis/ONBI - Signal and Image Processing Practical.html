<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This practical requires Matlab. Go through the instructions and execute the listed
  commands in a Matlab command window (you can copy-paste). Don't click on
  the "answers" links until you have thought hard about the
  questions. Raise your hand if you need help, but perhaps try first
  the "help" command in Matlab if you are unsure about Matlab syntax issues.

<h2><a name="fourier"> Fourier analysis </a></h2>

<p>To start with, let us create some simple 1D signals and examine
  their Fourier transforms. In this first example, we will check the
  frequency content of a simple periodic signal. 
</p><p>Generate a cosine signal with given magnitude, frequency, sampling
  rate, and duration:

</p><pre>  mag  = 2;     % magnitude (arbitrary units)
  freq = 5;     % frequency in Hz
  samp = 100;   % sampling rate in Hz

  t        = 0:1/samp:1;  % time (1s of data)
  t        = t(1:end-1);  % remove last time point
  N        = length(t);   % store the number of time points

  x = mag*cos(2*pi*freq*t);    % the signal equation
  figure
  plot(t,x,'.-');

</pre>
<p>If you run the code above, you can see a nice cosine function. Make
  sure you understand the distinction between the sampling rate (in
  this case number of data points per second) and the frequency of the
  signal (number of cycles per second). In this case, since we have
  generated a signal that has a duration of 1 second, you should be
  able to easily count the number of cycles per second :)

</p><p>You may wonder why I removed the last time point? This is simply
  because when doing an FFT, matlab assumes that the
  signal you give it is periodic, repeating itself indefinitely. So if
  I want matlab to think the signal is a pure infinite cosine
  function, I need to stop just before the next cycle. If you don't
  understand this, don't worry, it's not important, just carry on..

</p><p>Now, let us immediately look at the Fourier transform
  of this signal.

</p><pre>  y  = fft(x);             % do Fast Fourier Transform
  f  = linspace(0,N-1,N);  % vector of frequencies for plotting

  figure
  plot(f,abs(y),'.-');     % plotting the magnitude of the FFT

</pre>
<p>This plot is called a <b>powerspectrum</b>. The first peak coincides with the frequency of the cosine
function (check this). The second peak is redundant (for mathematical
reasons). Therefore, from now on we will only display the first half of
the fourier transform:
</p><pre>  figure
  plot(f(1:N/2),abs(y(1:N/2)));  % plotting half of the fft results
  xlabel('Freq (Hz)');           % labelling x-axis
</pre>
<p>Notice how the peak of the powerspectrum corresponds exactly to the
  frequency of the original signal. Now what happens to the
  powerspectrum when we:
</p><ul>
<li>Change the frequency of the signal?
<span class="clickme" onclick="showIt(&#39;ans1&#39;)">Answer</span> 
  <div id="ans1" class="answer" style="display: none"> 
    This one is easy: the peak moves to the new frequency. But what
    happens when the frequency is zero? In this case, the signal is
    flat (constant) and the FFT gives a peak at zero.
  </div> 
</li><li>Change the magnitude of the signal?
<span class="clickme" onclick="showIt(&#39;ans2&#39;)">Answer</span> 
  <div id="ans2" class="answer" style="display: none"> 
    <p>The magnitude of the peak also changes. In general, Parseval's theorem
    tells us that the sum of squares of the signal equals the mean of
    squares of its Fourier transform. You can verify this by
    comparing:
      </p><pre>	sum(x.^2)
	mean(abs(y).^2)
      </pre>
    <p>Another important and interesting property is that the
    zero-frequency value of the Fourier transform corresponds to the
    sum of the original signal. You can verify this by adding a
    constant to the cosine signal that you have generated:
      </p><pre>	x2 = x+3;
	y  = fft(x2);
	figure, plot(f(1:N/2),abs(y(1:N/2)),'.-');
      </pre>
      <p>You can see that y(1)=sum(x2)=300.
  </p></div> 

</li><li>Change the phase of the signal?
<span class="clickme" onclick="showIt(&#39;ans3&#39;)">Answer</span> 
  <div id="ans3" class="answer" style="display: none"> 
    <p>The peak of the powerspectrum does not move in this case:
    </p><pre>      phase = 2*pi*10; 
      x2    = mag*cos(2*pi*freq*t+phase);
      y  = fft(x2);
      figure, plot(f(1:N/2),abs(y(1:N/2)),'.-');      
    </pre>
      <p>However, in general the result of an FFT is a complex signal,
      with both amplitude and phase. Whilst the amplitude of the FFT
      does not change when we change the phase of the signal, the
      phase of the FFT does. We will have a closer look at phase later
      on in this practical.
  </p></div> 
</li><li>Change the sampling rate?
<span class="clickme" onclick="showIt(&#39;ans4&#39;)">Answer</span> 
  <div id="ans4" class="answer" style="display: none"> 
    <p>The higher the sampling rate, the more samples there are in the
    FFT. However, if the sampling rate falls below twice the frequency
    of the signal, the powerspectrum begins to show weird behaviour
    (the peak is no longer at the right place - try it!). This is
    called aliasing, and is explained by the Nyquist theorem. We will
    revisit aliasing further down.
  </p></div> 
</li></ul>

<p>Now let's do the opposite to the above. Instead of creating a
  signal and looking at its FFT, we are going to create an FFT and
  look at its signal. We will use the inverse FFT function in matlab
  (<code>ifft</code>). 
</p><p>We will create two signals, one that is the magnitude and one that is the
  phase, and we will look at the inverse fourier
  transform of these:

</p><pre>  mag = zeros(1,100);
  mag(3)=1;        % spike in the magnitude at freq=3
  mag(5)=.3;       % spike in the magnitude at freq=5

  ph=zeros(1,100); % zero phase throughout

  y = mag.*exp(1i*ph);  % the complex signal (fft of some real signal)
  x = ifft(y);          % the inverse fft (x is in general complex too)
  x = real(x);          % here we imagine that we can "measure" the real part of x

  z = ifft(mag);        % here we just use the magnitude to do the ifft
  z = real(z);

  figure,hold on
  plot(x,'.-r')   % plot the real part of the signal
  plot(z,'.-b')   % plot the ifft of the magnitude
</pre>
<p>To clarify, in the above I've
  used <code>y=mag.*exp(1i*ph)</code>. This is how you write a complex
  number given its magnitude and phase (an alternative is to use the
  real and imaginary parts). The notation <code>1i</code> is Matlab's
  code for the famous imaginary number sqrt(-1).
</p><p>Now try to change the phase of the signal. You can see that nothing
  changes unless you modify the 3rd and 5th entry of the phase
  signal (corresponding to the 3rd and 5th frequencies with non-zero
  magnitude).
</p><p>Play a bit with changing the magnitude and phase signals and look
  at the result of the ifft. Compare the reconstructed signals with
  and without the phase.

</p><p>The Fourier transform is not only useful for simple periodic
  signals. Next, examine the Fourier transform of the following
  functions: exponential decay, delta-function, step function,
  constant, mixtures of periodic signals, random noise, smooth random
  noise. In playing with these FFTs, try to answer the following questions:

</p><ul>
<li> Exponential decay: how does the decay constant relate to the
  shape of the FFT?
<span class="clickme" onclick="showIt(&#39;ans5&#39;)">Answer</span> 
  <div id="ans5" class="answer" style="display: none"> 
    <p>An exponential decay with given decay rate:
      </p><pre>	mag = 2;      % magnitude (arbitrary units)
	dec = .3;     % decay rate (in seconds)
	samp = 100;   % sampling rate in Hz

	t        = 0:1/samp:1;  % time (1s of data)
	t        = t(1:end-1);  % remove last time point
	N        = length(t);   % store the number of time points

	x = mag*exp(-t/dec);    % the signal equation
	figure
	plot(t,x,'.-');

	y  = fft(x);           % do Fast Fourier Transform
	f  = linspace(0,N-1,N);  % vector of frequencies for plotting

	figure
	plot(f(1:N/2),abs(y(1:N/2)),'.-');  % plot powerspectrum

      </pre>      
    <p>Try changing the decay rate and notice an interesting fact: the
    wider the original signal, the tighter its Fourier transform. This
    is called the uncertainty principle (yes like Heisenberg's!). You
    can localise the signal or its Fourier transform, but not both.
  </p></div> 

</li><li> Delta function: how does the shape of the FFT relate to the
  location of the delta function? (hint: look at the phase as well as the
  magnitude)
<span class="clickme" onclick="showIt(&#39;ans6&#39;)">Answer</span> 
  <div id="ans6" class="answer" style="display: none"> 
    <p>The relevant parameter of a delta function is the location of
    the peak. We call it t0 below:
      </p><pre>	mag = 2;      % magnitude (arbitrary units)
	t0  = .3;     % peak location (in seconds)
	samp = 100;   % sampling rate in Hz

	t        = 0:1/samp:1;  % time (1s of data)
	t        = t(1:end-1);  % remove last time point
	N        = length(t);   % store the number of time points

	x                   = zeros(1,N);     % signal
	x(1+round(samp*t0)) = mag;

	figure
	plot(t,x,'.-');

	y  = fft(x);           % do Fast Fourier Transform
	f  = linspace(0,N-1,N);  % vector of frequencies for plotting

	figure
	plot(f(1:N/2),abs(y(1:N/2)),'.-');            % plot powerspectrum
	figure
	plot(f(1:N/2),unwrap(angle(y(1:N/2))),'.-');  % plot unwrapped phase of FFT

      </pre>      
    <p>The first thing to notice about the delta function is that the
    powerspectrum is flat. This is an extreme case of the uncertainty
    principle (see exponential function above): when the signal is
    extremely localised, the fourier transform is flat. Remember that we have seen
    the opposite earlier: when the signal is flat (constant), its FFT
    is a peak at zero.
    </p><p>Try changing the localisation of the peak and notice that the
    powerspectrum doesn't change, but the phase of the FFT changes (we
    unwrapped the phase because Matlab's FFT wraps it when it gets to
    -pi and pi). 
    </p><p>Changing the peak location, it looks like the phase map is
    linear with a slope that decreases linearly with the location of
    the peak. This is a mathematical result in Fourier analysis: a
    translation in real space corresponds to a multiplication by a
    phase ramp in Fourier space.
  </p></div> 

</li><li> Random noise: what happens to the FFT when we smooth random
  noise?
<span class="clickme" onclick="showIt(&#39;ans7&#39;)">Answer</span> 
  <div id="ans7" class="answer" style="display: none"> 
    <p>Let's start by generating some random noise and looking at the
    FFT (let's not bother this time with units):
      </p><pre>	x = randn(1,1000);
	y = fft(x);
	figure, plot(x)
	figure, plot(abs(y(1:500)));
      </pre>
    <p>The powerspectrum is noisy, but flat. Now let's apply some
    smoothing:
      </p><pre>	x = randn(1,1000);
	x = smooth(x,10);  % try changing the second entry
	y = fft(x);
	figure, plot(x)
	figure, plot(abs(y(1:500)));     	
      </pre>
    <p>More smoothing changes the powerspectrum from being flat to
    having a peak at zero frequency. This is called "coloured" noise,
    because instead of having the same amount in all frequencies (like
    white noise), it has different amounts at different frequencies.
</p></div>
</li></ul>
<p>

</p><h3>Inverse FFT</h3>
<p>Now let's play a little more with the inverse fourier transform, i.e. getting the
  signal back given its Fourier transform. This is particularly
  relevant for applications (such as MRI) where we measure the Fourier
  transform of an object, and we want to reconstruct the object from
  its Fourier transform.

</p><p>Let us go back to our first example of a cosine signal. Plot the
  signal, then calculate its FFT, then invert that transform and plot
  the result. (here the original signal has a phase, i.e. at t=0 it is
  not equal to 1):
</p><pre>  mag  = 2;     % magnitude (arbitrary units)
  freq = 5;     % frequency in Hz
  samp = 100;   % sampling rate in Hz

  t        = 0:1/samp:1;  % time (1s of data)
  t        = t(1:end-1);  % remove last time point
  N        = length(t);   % store the number of time points

  x = mag*cos(2*pi*freq*t + 10);    % the signal equation (+phase)
  figure
  plot(t,x,'.-');

  y  = fft(x);           % do Fast Fourier Transform
  z  = ifft(y);

  hold on, 
  plot(t,z,'r--');
</pre>
<p>The <code>ifft</code> simply gives us the original signal back. Now let us try a few
  experiments. What happens if we:
</p><ul>
<li> Remove the phase information prior to ifft?
<span class="clickme" onclick="showIt(&#39;ans8&#39;)">Answer</span> 
  <div id="ans8" class="answer" style="display: none"> 
    <p>In this case, the reconstructed signal looks like the original
    signal but shifted.
      </p><pre>	y2 = abs(y);
	z  = ifft(y2);
	figure,hold on
	plot(t,x),plot(t,z,'r--');
      </pre>
  </div>
</li><li> Remove the magnitude information prior to ifft?
<span class="clickme" onclick="showIt(&#39;ans9&#39;)">Answer</span> 
  <div id="ans9" class="answer" style="display: none"> 
    <p>In this case, the reconstructed signal looks nothing like the original
    signal. You will see later that this is only true for simple
    periodic signals. In the case where a signal contains interesting
    features (e.g. transitions), the phase part of the FFT is more
    important than the magnitude.
      </p><pre>	y2 = exp(1i*angle(y));
	z  = ifft(y2);
	figure,hold on
	plot(t,x),plot(t,z,'r--');
      </pre>
  </div>

</li><li> Introduce "artefacts" in the fft prior to ifft? (meaning change
  the magnitude and phase slightly, as if there were measurement errors).
<span class="clickme" onclick="showIt(&#39;ans10&#39;)">Answer</span> 
  <div id="ans10" class="answer" style="display: none"> 
    <p>Let's try a few things: add spikes in the phase, spikes in the
    magnitude, delete points from either.
      </p><pre>	mag = abs(y);   mag(20) = 10; % spike in magnitude
	ph  = angle(y); ph(10)  = 1;  % spike in phase

	y2 = mag.*exp(1i*ph);
	z  = real(ifft(y2));
	figure,hold on
	plot(t,x),plot(t,z,'r--');
      </pre>
    <p>Play a bit with the above. You notice that spikes in the
    magnitude can introduce quite nasty effects (extra oscillations). 
  </p></div>


</li></ul> 

<h3>Time-frequency plots</h3>
<p>Sometimes a signal can have non-stationarities, i.e. behave
  differently at different time-points. In such cases, it is useful to
  be able to look at how the frequency content may vary over time. 
</p><p>Download sample EEG data from
   <a href="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/~saad/ONBI/eeg.mat">here</a>. 
</p><p>Start by looking at the
  powerspectrum of the data (the sampling rate for this data was
  128Hz). 
</p><pre>  load('eeg.mat');

  samp = 128;                 % sampling rate in Hz
  T    = 1/samp*length(eeg);  % total duration (in seconds)
  
  N    = length(eeg);          % store the number of time points
  f    = linspace(0,N-1,N)/T;  % vector of frequencies for plotting

  y = fft(eeg);
  plot(f(1:N/2),abs(y(1:N/2)));
</pre>
<p>Note how we divide by the total duration to get the frequencies. We
  didn't do that before because we generated 1 second of data. 
</p><p>There are several peaks in the powerspectrum. The peak at 60Hz is a
  contamination from the mains (the current that comes from the wall).
</p><p>Now let's do a "sliding window" FFT, i.e. do an FFT for small time
  windows and display the results as a time-by-frequency plot:
</p><pre>  window = 1;            % 1 second window
  nbins  = window*samp;  % corresponding number of time points

  F = zeros(nbins/2,length(1:N-nbins));

  for i=1:N-nbins
    x = eeg(i:i+nbins-1);
    y = fft(x);
    F(:,k) = abs(y(1:nbins/2));  % only keep half of the fft  
  end  
</pre>
<p>Now plot the resulting spectrum using <code>imagesc</code>:
</p><pre>  figure,hold on
  imagesc(log1p(F)); 
</pre>
<p>We used a log transform to better see the colours and
  patterns. Now let's add the frequency axis and time label:
</p><pre>  set(gca,'ytick',1:4:nbins/2,'yticklabel',num2str((0:4:nbins/2-1)'/window));
  xlabel('time')
</pre>
<p>You should be able to see several features. First, the constant
  60Hz signal (the mains). Second, most of the power is in the low
  frequencies (which is what you should have seen in the overall
  powerspectrum above). There are however bursts of changes in the
  frequencies (vertical red lines in the time-frequency
  spectrum).These correspond to events in the EEG experiment (I
  believe this is a visual task).
</p><p>You can also see that the time-frequency spectrum (also called
  spectrogram) is a bit pixelized, this is because we have used a very
  dumb, windowed approach to build it. There are several techniques to
  make the windowing more clever.
</p><p>Before you move on, perhaps you can try a few different values for
  the sliding window and see how the spectrogram changes.




</p><h3>2D Fourier transform</h3>
<p>The 2 dimensional version of FFT in matlab is called FFT2. It is equivalent to
  doing an FFT along one dimension then along the other. 

</p><p>Let's look at the 2D FFT using images. First, we are
  going to create an image from its FFT, to understand how the
  magnitude and phase relate to the image. 

</p><p>Create an image using a single spike in the magnitude and the
  function <code>ifft2</code>:
</p><pre>  mag=zeros(100,100);  % magnitude (all zeros for now)
  ph=zeros(100,100);   % phase (all zeros for now)

  mag(2,3)=1;          % 1 cycle in x, 2 cycles in y

  y=mag.*exp(1i*ph);   % build fft combining mag and phase
  x=real(ifft2(y));    % inverse fft (then take real part)
  imagesc(x)           % plot

</pre>
<p>This needs some explaining. First, we've created a magnitude of 1
  using mag(2,3)=1. Think of (2,3) as the 2nd and 3rd frequencies
  along x and y respectively. The coordinate (1,1), which is the first
  frequency, corresponds to zero frequency.
</p><p>You should be able to clearly see a periodic pattern that contains
  1 cycle along x and 2 cycles along y. You can see that even more
  clearly by plotting a row or a column of x:
</p><pre>  figure,hold on
  plot(x(:,1));
  plot(x(1,:),'r');
  legend({'x axis','y axis'});
</pre>

<p>Now move the amplitude spike to different locations
  (e.g. mag(5,10)=1 etc.) and look at the image obtained. Do the same
  with the phase. Can you predict what happens before you visualise
  the result?
</p><p>Try adding more spikes and look at the image (e.g. a 2 cycle spike
  and a 4 cycle spike, etc.). You should be able to see the image
  getting more and more complicated. 


</p><p>Now we will apply the 2D Fourier transform to a picture. 
Download a picture of a cat from
  here: <a href="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/~saad/ONBI/cat.jpg">CAT</a>. Display
  the image. 
</p><pre>  im = imread('cat.jpg');
  im = im(:,:,1);  % only keep one colour channel

  figure, imshow(im)
</pre>

<p>Beautiful no? Now let's look at its FFT (both the magnitude and phase):

  </p><pre>    y=fft2(im);

    clim=quantile(abs(y(:)),[.01 .99]);
    figure
    imagesc(fftshift(abs(y)),clim);colormap gray
    title('magnitude');

    clim=quantile(angle(y(:)),[.01 .99]);
    figure
    imagesc(fftshift(angle(y)),clim);colormap gray
    title('phase')

</pre>
<p>Now not so beautiful hey? Ok, first make sure you understand the
  code above. We used <code>fftshift</code>. That is because of the
  way fft works in matlab (type help to read about
  this). <code>fftshift</code> recenters the results so that zero
  frequencies are in the centre (compare the code
  above with and without <code>fftshift</code>). Also, don't pay too much attention to
  the use of the quantile function (although read the help if you
  haven't encountered it). We are only using it to help with
  visualisation in imagesc.
</p><p>The key things to notice from the fft of the cat image is that: (1)
  the magnitude is mostly centered around zero, i.e. lots of low
  frequencies, and (2) the phase image is difficult to interpret. This
  is typical of real images.

</p><p>Let's now try to reconstruct the image from its FFT, but using
  incomplete versions of the FFT. What happens if:
</p><ul>
<li>We only use the magnitude?
<span class="clickme" onclick="showIt(&#39;ans11&#39;)">Answer</span> 
<div id="ans11" class="answer" style="display: none"> 
  <pre>    mag = abs(y);
    x   = ifft2(mag);
    figure,imagesc(real(x));   
  </pre>
  <p>doesn't look very good. Let's use the quantiles for display:
    </p><pre>      clim=quantile(real(x(:)),[0.01 0.99]);
      imagesc(x,clim);
    </pre>
  <p>hmm, definitely doesn't look like a cat...
</p></div>
</li><li>We only use the phase?
<span class="clickme" onclick="showIt(&#39;ans12&#39;)">Answer</span> 
<div id="ans12" class="answer" style="display: none">

    figure,imagesc(real(x),clim);   
  </pre>
  <p>Looks like a cat! Well, not as nice as the original, but better
  than just reconstructing the magnitude. This is because the
  magnitude tells us what is happening (in terms of frequencies), and
  the phase tells us "where" it is happening. So while magnitude was
  sufficient for simple signals like a cosine, it fails for complex
  signals like natural images, because then it really matters where
  the oscillations are localised.

<h3>Sampling and aliasing</h3>
<p>Something that should have been obvious so far is that the data we
  have been using are discrete. You can think of them as "samples"
  from a continuous underlying data. Here we examine the effect of
  sampling continuous data, in terms of the FFT, and in terms of
  trying to reconstruct a "true" continuous object from samples or
  samples of its FFT. 

</p><p>The most important fact about sampling is this: taking samples in
  real space is the same as repeating the Fourier transform
  periodically, and the period of repetition is the inverse of the
  sampling period. Read this again to make sure you understand
  it. Perhaps the picture below can help:
</p><p>
<img src="./ONBI - Signal and Image Processing Practical_files/sampling.png" alt="Sampling image" width="600" height="320">

</p><p>And the image below shows that it is also true the other way round:
</p><p>
<img src="./ONBI - Signal and Image Processing Practical_files/sampling2.png" alt="Sampling image" width="600" height="320">

</p><p>Now, the above is true in general for the Fourier transform. But in
  signal processing and the world of discrete data, we are doing a
  discrete Fourier transform with the FFT. So in practice, <b>both</b>
  the real and the Fourier domains are given by samples. This means
  that they are both sampled, and they are both repeated! See the
  figure below:
</p><p>
<img src="./ONBI - Signal and Image Processing Practical_files/sampling3.png" alt="Sampling image" width="600" height="320">

</p><p>Now, when you run an FFT in matlab, the repeating pattern is not
  apparent. That is because matlab implicitly considers the signal and
  its FFT to be periodic (i.e. repeating) and only gives you one
  period. 

</p><p>How does the above information help us understand sampling? Well,
  let's simulate a simple signal that consists of the superposition of
  two cosine functions. We will simulate this signal at high sampling
  rate (as if it was continuous), and see what happens when we downsample it. Begin by
  generating the signal:
</p><pre>  freq1 = 5;      % freq in Hz
  freq2 = 1;      % freq in Hz
  samp  = 1000;   % sampling rate in Hz

  t        = 0:1/samp:1;  % time (1s of data)
  t        = t(1:end-1);  % remove last time point
  N        = length(t);   % store the number of time points

  x = cos(2*pi*freq1*t) + .5*cos(2*pi*freq2*t);    % the signal equation
  figure
  plot(t,x,'.-');

</pre>

<p>Now remember: this signal is assumed by matlab to be periodic, so
  even though it has finite duration, it will be treated by the FFT as
  if it were repeating, and therefore as if it were a true cosine
  function. 

</p><p>Let's see what happens when we take subsamples from this signal
  (make sure you understand all the code below):
</p><pre>  F = 50;    % sub-sampling frequency (Hz)
  T = 1/F;   % sub-sampling period (sec)
  n = N*T;   % sub-sampling period (in samples)

  z = x(1:n:end);    % sub-sampled signal
  y = fft(z);        % fft of sub-sampled signal

  subN = length(z);  % length of sub-sampled signal


  f  = linspace(0,subN-1,subN);  % vector of frequencies for plotting

  figure
  plot(f(1:subN/2),abs(y(1:subN/2))) % plot powerspectrum as before

</pre>
<p>Now change the frequency of sub-sampling and see what happens to
  the fourier transform. You should be able to see that as soon as you
  drop below 10Hz, you loose the peak at 5Hz in the powerspectrum. Try
  to use the <code>ifft</code> function to reconstruct the signal from
  its fft and compare it to the almost continuous version. 
 <span class="clickme" onclick="showIt(&#39;ans15&#39;)">Example</span> 
</p><div id="ans15" class="answer" style="display: none"> 
  <p>First generate the (almost) continuous mixture of two cosines:
  </p><pre>    freq1 = 5;      % freq in Hz
    freq2 = 1;      % freq in Hz
    samp  = 1000;   % sampling rate in Hz

    t        = 0:1/samp:1;  % time (1s of data)
    t        = t(1:end-1);  % remove last time point
    N        = length(t);   % store the number of time points

    x = cos(2*pi*freq1*t) + .5*cos(2*pi*freq2*t);    % the signal equation
    figure
    plot(t,x,'.-');
  </pre>
  <p>Next sub-sample the signal and calculate the FFT of the
  sub-sampled signal:
    </p><pre>      F = 50;    % sub-sampling frequency (Hz)
      T = 1/F;  % sub-sampling period (sec)
      n = N*T;  % sub-sampling perior (in samples)

      z = x(1:n:end); % sub-sampled signal
      y = fft(z);
    </pre>
  <p>
    Now reconstruct the signal from its FFT and plot:
    </p><pre>      w = ifft(y);  
      hold on
      plot(t,w,'r--');
    </pre>
  <p>The reconstructed signal looks very similar to the original
  one. Try now with lower sampling frequency and notice that things
  break down below 10Hz because of aliasing.
  
</p></div>

<p>Now let us look at another concept that we haven't looked at so
  far: <b>zero padding</b>. We will use the 2D FFT and the cat example
  to get an understanding of zero padding. First load the image and
  downsample it by removing every other pixel:
  </p><pre>  im=imread('cat.jpg');
  x=im(1:2:end,1:2:end,1);  
  figure
  imshow(x)
</pre>
<p>Now let's look at the FFT of this image:
</p><pre>  y=fft2(x);
  clim=quantile(abs(y(:)),[.01 .99]);
  figure
  imagesc(fftshift(abs(y)),clim);colormap gray
</pre>

<p>Now let us recall the sampling pictures that we showed above. They
  tell us that repeating the Fourier transform is the same as taking
  samples in real space. Furthermore, the repeating period is
  inversely related to the sampling period. 
</p><p>Zero padding means adding zeros on either side of the FFT before
  reconstructing the signal. Since the matlab FFT assumes the signal
  to be periodic, zeropadding is like repeating the signal with
  increased repeat period, which in the real domain means higher
  sampling rate. Therefore, zero padding allows us to reconstruct an
  image at higher resolution than the frequency domain allows us to,
  and is closely related to the concept of interpolation. 
</p><p>Let's see what the zero padded inverse FFT of the cat looks like:
  </p><pre>    y = fftshift(y); % we need this before zero padding
    z = ifft2(y,size(im,1),size(im,2)); % zero padded ifft
    clim=quantile(abs(z(:)),[.01 .99]);
    figure,imshow(abs(z),clim);colormap gray
  </pre>

<p>Compare to the original image, you should notice strange patterns
  of "oscillations" caused by the interpolation. 


</p><hr>
<h2><a name="filtering">Filtering</a></h2>
<p>Here we will implement a simple linear filter using convolution and
  the Fourier transform. 
</p><p>Recall that convolution in real space is the same as multiplication
  in Fourier space, and vice versa. But convolution is more difficult
  to implement than multiplication, so often it is a good idea to do a
  Fourier transform of the signal and the filter, then multiply the
  two FFTs together, and then do an inverse FFT.
</p><p>Let's first design a filter. We are going to do this in 2D, so load
  the cat image if you haven't done that yet. 
</p><p>Now let's create a "moving average" filter (also called the mean filter). This means a box that
  we are going to run through the image and take local averages. 
</p><pre>  siz = [3 3];   % 3x3 box. You can play with changing this
  box = ones(siz)/9;
</pre>
<p>Now we could create a loop through all the image and for each pixel
  of the image replace the value by the weighted average within the
  small box. Instead, we are going to do this via a Fourier
  transform. First, let's calculate the Fourier transform of the image
  and the filter:
</p><pre>  x=im(:,:,1);
  y=fft2(x);

  f=fft2(box,size(x,1),size(x,2));  % use zeropadding
  
  z=ifft2(y.*f);  % inverse FFT of the product

  figure,
  clim=quantile(abs(z(:)),[.01 .99]);
  imagesc(abs(z),clim);colormap gray
</pre>
<p>Beautifully simple no? Imagine doing this with a loop, and having
  to worry about the edges of the image etc.  The effect of a moving
  average filter is to blur the image, which can be useful for
  denoising. Try with different filter sizes, what do you notice? 

</p><p>A better behaved filter is the Gaussian filter. It is similar to
  the mean filter, except that instead of the values in the box being
  constant, they follow a Gaussian function centered in the middle of
  the box and with given standard deviation. 
</p><p>Now that you have seen the mean filter, try to implement the
  Gaussian filter before you click on the 
 <span class="clickme" onclick="showIt(&#39;ans16&#39;)">answer</span> 
</p><div id="ans16" class="answer" style="display: none">   
  <p>Let's first create the Gaussian box:
  </p><pre>    gauss = zeros(15,15);   % size of the filter can be changed

    sigma  = 10;             % sigma of the Gaussian (in pixels)
    centre = [size(gauss,1)/2 size(gauss,2)/2]; % centre of the box

    for i=1:size(gauss,1)
     for j=1:size(gauss,2)
      gauss(i,j) = exp(- sum(([i j]-centre).^2)/2/sigma^2 );
     end
    end
    gauss = gauss/sum(gauss(:));
  </pre>
  <p>Plot the Gaussian box (also called kernel) to see what it looks
  like:
    </p><pre>      figure;
      imagesc(gauss);
    </pre>
    
  <p>Now convolve it with the cat image using the FFT trick:
    </p><pre>      
      x=im(:,:,1);
      y=fft2(x);

      f=fft2(gauss,size(x,1),size(x,2));  % use zeropadding
      
      z=ifft2(y.*f);  % inverse FFT of the product

      figure,
      clim=quantile(abs(z(:)),[.01 .99]);
      imagesc(abs(z),clim);colormap gray
    </pre>
</div>
<p>Try to use the Gaussian filter to denoise the cat image (add some
  noise with the <code>randn</code> function and then convolve the result with the
  Gaussian filter.

</p><p>Let's now design another type of filter: an edge detection
  filter. The simplest such filter is to do a derivative, which in
  discrete terms is
  simply the difference between adjacent pixels. 
</p><p>Here are simple finite difference filters:
</p><pre>  box = [-1 1];    % along x-dimension
  box = [-1;1];    % along y-dimension
  box = [-1 0 1];  % a slightly better filter along x
  box = [-1;0;1];  % a slightly better filter along y

</pre>
<p>Now let's apply these filters to the cat image:
</p><pre>  x=im(:,:,1);
  y=fft2(x);

  box = [-1 0 1]; % try with different ones if you have time
  f=fft2(box,size(x,1),size(x,2));  % use zeropadding
  
  z=ifft2(y.*f);  % inverse FFT of the product

  figure,
  clim=quantile(abs(z(:)),[.01 .99]);
  imagesc(abs(z),clim);colormap gray
</pre>
<p>You should be able to see edges along the x-dimension in the image
  (similarly along the y dimension if you used the y-derivative
  filter). These types of operations are extremely widely used in
  image processing for extracting basic information from images. Other
  types of filtering operations are also possible (such as non-linear
  filters), but these can't be implemented with the Fourier
  transform. 





</p><hr>
<h2><a name="imaging">Image reconstruction</a></h2>
<h3>Computed Tomography</h3>
<p>Image reconstruction means constructing the image of an object from
  measurements. Here we are going to see two types of image
  reconstruction which are at the basis of two very popular imaging
  techniques: The Radon transform, which is at the heart of computed
  tomography (CT), and the Fourier transform, which is the basis of
  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).

</p><p>You should be quite familiar with the Fourier transform by now, so
  for a bit of a change, let's examine the Radon transform. 

</p><p>The Radon transform takes an object, and calculates integrals along
  lines crossing through the object at different angles. The figure
  below illustrates this process:
</p><p>
<img src="./ONBI - Signal and Image Processing Practical_files/radon.png" alt="Sampling image" width="300" height="300">
</p><p>In CT, X-rays are emitted by a source, they then go through an
  object (typically a body) and get absorbed to various degrees before
  hitting a detector. The signal that is measured is an integral along
  a line from the source to the detector that calculates how much
  absorption there was. So it is easy to see how this relates to the
  radon transform.
</p><p>Now, we are faced with the problem of reconstructing the object
  (body organs), given CT measurements along various angles. The Radon
  theorem tells us that we can recontruct the object perfectly if we
  have an infinite number of measurement angles, but in practice this
  is never the case. So let's see how few measurements we can get away
  with.
</p><p>First, we need an object. We are going to remain in 2 dimensions,
  and we are going to use the most famous image in medical imaging:
  the Shepp-Logan phantom. This image is so popular that it is
  included in Matlab's imaging toolbox, so let's create it:
</p><pre>  im=phantom;
  figure, imagesc(im), colormap gray
</pre>

<p>Let's calculate the Radon transform along a single orientation:
</p><pre>  R = radon(im,0);
  figure, plot(R);
</pre>
<p>The above simply sums the values inside the phatom along lines that
  are parallel to the x-axis. You can see that by comparing R to
  sum(im). The only difference is that R has more points to account
  for the fact that summing along directions that are at an angle
  spans a wider number of pixels in the image.
</p><p>Now let's look at the Radon transform along more angle and plot the
  results:
</p><pre>  R = radon(im,linspace(0,180,40));   % 40 angles from 0 to 180 degrees
  figure, imagesc(R);
</pre>
<p>This funky looking image is your measurement. Now let's calculate
  an inverse Radon transform and see what the object looks like:
</p><pre>  x = iradon(R,linspace(0,180,40));
  figure,imagesc(x),colormap gray
</pre>
<p>The inverse Radon transfrom is also called back-projection. You can
  clearly see that this back-projection leaves "trails" behind when it
  tries to reconstruct the object.  Try the above with different
  numbers of projections to get a feel for how many is enough. Note
  also that the small details in the object require more angles in
  order to be properly recovered.

</p><p>In CT, the measurement is actually not exactly the integral of the
  object along the X-ray beam, but the integral of the "absorption"
  along the beams. But we will ignore that and pretend that we are
  measuring the integral of the object's mass. Next we are going to
  introduce a "metal" artefact. This happens when a patient has an
  implant inside their body. We can model that by introducing a spike
  in the original phantom image:
</p><pre>  im(100,80)=100; 
</pre>
<p>Now run the radon transform (to simulate the measurement process)
  and then the iradon transform (reconstruction of the object from the
  measurements). You should be able to see some striking artefacts
  caused by the simulated metal implan. 
</p><pre>  R = radon(im,linspace(0,180,100));
  x = iradon(R,linspace(0,180,100));
  figure,imagesc(x,[0 1]);colormap gray
</pre>

<p>The Radon transform is related to the Fourier transform via
  the <b>projection-slice theorem</b>. This theorem states that if you
  have an object (e.g. in 2D), then projecting the object onto a line
  is the same as taking a slice through the 2D Fourier transform of
  the object:
</p><p>
<img src="./ONBI - Signal and Image Processing Practical_files/sliceproj.png" alt="Sampling image" width="500" height="400">

</p><p>Let us try to verify the projection-slice theorem on the phantom
  image. To simplify things, let's just try a projection along either
  X or Y axis (which can be done with the <code>sum</code> function in
  Matlab). 
<span class="clickme" onclick="showIt(&#39;ans17&#39;)">Answer</span> 
</p><div id="ans17" class="answer" style="display: none">   
  <pre>    im=phantom;
    proj = sum(im,1);   % projection on the x axis (along the y axis)
    f1d  = fft(proj);   % 1D Fourier
    f2d  = fft2(im);    % 2D Fourier
    slice = f2d(1,:);   % slice along x (through zero frequency)
    
    figure,hold on
    plot(abs(f1d),'b'); plot(abs(slice),'r--');
    figure,hold on
    plot(angle(f1d),'b'); plot(angle(slice),'r--');        
  </pre>
  
</div>
<p>The projection-slice theorem therefore tells us that we can measure
  the entire 2D FFT of an object by calculating the 1D FFT of its
  projections along different angles. Therefore, we can, with an
  inverse 2D FFT, reconstruct the object from its Radon transform
  (i.e. provides a method for performing an inverse Radon transform). 
As an exercise, you may try to implement the inverse radon transform
of an image using the projection-slice theorem and the ifft.
 
</p><h3>MRI</h3>
<p>In MRI, the measurement of an object does not consist in integrals
  along lines. Instead, we directly measure the Fourier transform of
  the object. Typically, we measure the 2D Fourier transform of a
  slice through the object (e.g. in a technique called Echo Planar
  Imaging). 

</p><p>The Fourier space in MRI is called k-space. You can imagine k-space
  to be an image, where each pixel is a k-space sample, consisting of
  a complex number (magnitude and phase). Image reconstruction is then
  simply implemented with an inverse FFT (but with many twists
  depending on how sophisticated the measurement is).

</p><p>Because of time limitations in typical experiments, we can only
  measure a smallish number of k-space pixels. This has consequences
  in terms of the quality of the reconstructed image, and many
  artefacts in MRI come from what happens when we measure k-space.

</p><p>There are a number of MRI artefacts. In the remainder of this
  practical, we are going to simulate 3 types of artefacts that are
  frequent in MRI: Gibb's ringing, ghosting, and T2* blurring.

</p><p>But first, download
  this <a href="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/~saad/ONBI/brain.bmp">brain</a>
  and load it into matlab:
</p><pre>  im=imread('brain.bmp');  
</pre>
<p>Remember that in MRI, we measure the FFT of the object, aka
  k-space. Let's generate a measured k-space data (and also centre k-space using <code>fftshift</code>):
</p><pre>  data = fftshift(fft2(im));
</pre>

<h4>Gibb's ringing</h4>
<p>Gibb's ringing occurs when the frequencies that are sampled in
  k-space are not sufficiently high (remember: high frequencies are at
  the edges of k-space, low frequencies at the centre). We simulate
  this by "cutting" k-space along one of the two axes, as if we didn't
  have enough time to acquire these data. To exagerate the ringing, we
  will cut quite a lot of the high frequencies:
</p><pre>  K = data(:,112:112+32-1);   % this turns k-space from 256x256 to 256x32
</pre>
<p>And now reconstruct the object as a full 256x256 (with zero padding,
  remember?):
</p><pre>  x = ifft2(K,256,256);
  figure, imagesc(abs(x));    % we typically look at the magnitude 
</pre>
<p>You should be able to see the ringing artefacts along the
  horizontal axis but not the vertical axis.

</p><h4>Ghosting</h4>
<p>Ghosting happens when even and odd k-space lines are intensity
  modulated differently. We are going to simulate this by taking every other line in
  k-space and scaling them by 80 percent:
</p><pre>   K=data;
   K(1:2:end,:) = 0.8*K(1:2:end,:);
   x=ifft2(K);
   figure, imagesc(abs(x));
</pre>
<p>You can see that the image gets "duplicated" and overlaps with
  itself along the dimension where we did the intensity modulation.  Try along the
  other dimension now:
</p><pre>   K=data;
   K(:,1:2:end) = 0.8*K(:,1:2:end);
   x=ifft2(K);
   figure, imagesc(abs(x));  
</pre>
<p>Why does this happen? One way to understand this is to notice that
  modulating every other slice of the k-space data is like taking the
  original k-space data (unmodulated), and adding to it k-space data
  that is sampled at 2 pixel intervals (or rather adding -0.2 times that). Now remember that sampling in
  one space is the same as repeating in the other space. Sampling with
  a period of 2 pixels is the same as repeating with a period of N/2
  pixels in the other space. So therefore, the reconstructed image is
  like the original images, plus a "ghost" image that is repeated with
  cycles of N/2 pixels.

</p><h4>T2* blurring</h4>
<p>The final MRI artefact that we will look at is T2* blurring. This
  particular artefact is due to the fact that when we acquire k-space
  data, the signal that we base our measurement on decays over time,
  with a time constant called T2* (don't ask why!).
</p><p>Typically, we acquire k-space, say, from the bottom to the top, so
  we will simulate an intensity drop along that direction:
</p><pre>  T2star = 20;            % milliseconds
  Ttotal = 100;           % time it takes to "read" k-space
  N      = size(data,1);  % number of pixels

  K = data;
  for i=1:size(K,2)
   K(:,i) = K(:,i).*exp(-linspace(0,Ttotal,N)'/T2star);
  end
</pre>
<p>Now let's reconstruct the object and see what happened:
</p><pre>  x=ifft2(K);
  figure,imagesc(abs(x));
</pre>
<p>You should be able to see some blurring along the vertical
  axis. The shorter the value of T2* is, the more blurring there is
  (try this!).
</p><p>Why does this happen? The easiest way to understand this is to
  consider that multiplying the k-space trajectory by an exponential
  decay is the same as doing a convolution of the image space with the
  Fourier transform of the exponential (which is called a
  Lorentzian function). This convolution operation effectively blurs
  the image.

</p><p>Ok, well done for getting to the end of the practical. If you have
  gone through it very fast and have plenty of time left, maybe you
  can explore other possible sources of k-space MRI artefacts and try to
  predict what happens to the object before you check with the inverse
  FFT. It should be fun!
